### Introduction
**CiteAudit** lets you upload a PDF and verify whether each citation actually exists; it also checks key metadata (authors, title, year, venue, and more) for accuracy. In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring the integrity of scientific references has never been more critical. CiteAudit provides a robust framework to automate this audit process, saving researchers time and preventing the propagation of "hallucinated" or incorrect citations.
